        <h2>What is WEB?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank">The Web</a> was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN.
            <br>He was motivated by the problem of storing, updating, and finding documents and data files in that large and constantly changing organization, as well as distributing them to collaborators outside CERN.
